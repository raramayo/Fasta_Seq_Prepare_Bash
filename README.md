## **Motivation**

```
The main motivation for generating this script was to be able to pre-process both transcriptome and/or proteome fasta files before subjecting them to computational analysis.
By default the (-d flag 'Dust Gremlings') of the script will remove characters that if present in the sequence have the potential to interfere and or abort the processing
of the file by certain software packages. This is particularly true for InterProScan, which is extremely sensitive to the presence of the character '*", which can usually be
found in ENSEMBL protein sequences. These characters, when found,  are replaced by the IUPAC 'X' (unknown).
In addition, the '-r', and '-s' flags, control the sorting of the transcriptome and/or proteome fasta sequences from large to small (-r flag), or from small to large (-s flag.
By default, the (-l flag) of the script removes transcripts '<=' than 150 nucleotides, and proteins '<=' than 50 amino-acids residues, unless other values are assigned.
If desired, the (-u flag) of the script can also remove sequences that are >= to a given size provided.
If activate, the (-f flag) of the script will remove sequences belonging to the following biotypes: IG_D_gene, IG_J_gene, TR_D_gene, and TR_J_gene, as defined by the fasta headers of
ENSEMBL transcriptome and/or protein sequences.
A fasta file could also be split into files containing a given number of sequences (e.g., 50000). This behavior (suppressed by default) is controlled by the (-i flag).
A  transcriptome and/or proteome file can also be clustered using CD-HIT-EST or CD-HIT, respectively, as controlled by the (-c flag). This behavior is suppressed by default.
If splitting and clustering of a given fasta file is simultaneously requested, the file will be first clustered and then the resulting clustered file will be split.
The (-x flag), controls the number of cores used in the clustering process. Finally, one can define the TMPDIR to be written to the same directory where the
script is being executed, if so desired.

### CDHIT (https://github.com/weizhongli/cdhit)
#### Version Number: 4.8.1

```
		====== CD-HIT version 4.8.1 (built on Jan 21 2024) ======

Usage: cd-hit [Options]

Options

   -i	input filename in fasta format, required, can be in .gz format
   -o	output filename, required
   -c	sequence identity threshold, default 0.9
 	this is the default cd-hit's "global sequence identity" calculated as:
 	number of identical amino acids or bases in alignment
 	divided by the full length of the shorter sequence
   -G	use global sequence identity, default 1
 	if set to 0, then use local sequence identity, calculated as :
 	number of identical amino acids or bases in alignment
 	divided by the length of the alignment
 	NOTE!!! don't use -G 0 unless you use alignment coverage controls
 	see options -aL, -AL, -aS, -AS
   -b	band_width of alignment, default 20
   -M	memory limit (in MB) for the program, default 800; 0 for unlimitted;
   -T	number of threads, default 1; with 0, all CPUs will be used
   -n	word_length, default 5, see user's guide for choosing it
   -l	length of throw_away_sequences, default 10
   -t	tolerance for redundance, default 2
   -d	length of description in .clstr file, default 20
 	if set to 0, it takes the fasta defline and stops at first space
   -s	length difference cutoff, default 0.0
 	if set to 0.9, the shorter sequences need to be
 	at least 90% length of the representative of the cluster
   -S	length difference cutoff in amino acid, default 999999
 	if set to 60, the length difference between the shorter sequences
 	and the representative of the cluster can not be bigger than 60
   -aL	alignment coverage for the longer sequence, default 0.0
 	if set to 0.9, the alignment must covers 90% of the sequence
   -AL	alignment coverage control for the longer sequence, default 99999999
 	if set to 60, and the length of the sequence is 400,
 	then the alignment must be >= 340 (400-60) residues
   -aS	alignment coverage for the shorter sequence, default 0.0
 	if set to 0.9, the alignment must covers 90% of the sequence
   -AS	alignment coverage control for the shorter sequence, default 99999999
 	if set to 60, and the length of the sequence is 400,
 	then the alignment must be >= 340 (400-60) residues
   -A	minimal alignment coverage control for the both sequences, default 0
 	alignment must cover >= this value for both sequences
   -uL	maximum unmatched percentage for the longer sequence, default 1.0
 	if set to 0.1, the unmatched region (excluding leading and tailing gaps)
 	must not be more than 10% of the sequence
   -uS	maximum unmatched percentage for the shorter sequence, default 1.0
 	if set to 0.1, the unmatched region (excluding leading and tailing gaps)
 	must not be more than 10% of the sequence
   -U	maximum unmatched length, default 99999999
 	if set to 10, the unmatched region (excluding leading and tailing gaps)
 	must not be more than 10 bases
   -B	1 or 0, default 0, by default, sequences are stored in RAM
 	if set to 1, sequence are stored on hard drive
 	!! No longer supported !!
   -p	1 or 0, default 0
 	if set to 1, print alignment overlap in .clstr file
   -g	1 or 0, default 0
 	by cd-hit's default algorithm, a sequence is clustered to the first
 	cluster that meet the threshold (fast cluster). If set to 1, the program
 	will cluster it into the most similar cluster that meet the threshold
 	(accurate but slow mode)
 	but either 1 or 0 won't change the representatives of final clusters
   -sc	sort clusters by size (number of sequences), default 0, output clusters by decreasing length
 	if set to 1, output clusters by decreasing size
   -sf	sort fasta/fastq by cluster size (number of sequences), default 0, no sorting
 	if set to 1, output sequences by decreasing cluster size
 	this can be very slow if the input is in .gz format
   -bak	write backup cluster file (1 or 0, default 0)
   -h	print this help
